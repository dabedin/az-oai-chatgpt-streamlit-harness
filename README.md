# Streamlit ChatGPT Harness

A fully python based Streamlit development harness for ChatGPT hosted in Azure OpenAI Service.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the Environment

To get started, you will need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project.  This file will contain the environment variables needed to run the app. You can make a copy of `local.env` and rename it to `.env` to get started.  You will need to fill in the following values:

```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=""
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=""
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=""
AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT=""
```

You can find the values for these variables in the Azure Portal, the API versions are listed in [this doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference).  
You will need to create an Azure OpenAI resource and deploy the ChatGPT model to it.  Once you have done that, you can find the values for these variables in the resource.

The app will load this .env file using the python-dotenv library.

### Running the App

To run the app, simply run the `streamlit run app.py`.  This will start the app on port 8501.  You can then access the app at `http://localhost:8501`. If running in a container, you will need to forward the port to your local machine if VSCode does not do it for you automatically.

### Devcontainer

This project is designed to be used with VSCode and the Remote Containers extension.  Once you have the extension installed, open the project in VSCode and you will be prompted to open the project in a container.  This will build the container and install all the dependencies.

### Python Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the python dependencies for this project.  The `devcontainer.json` file will automatically install these dependencies when the container is built.
